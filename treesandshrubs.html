            <h1>Trees & Shrubs</h1>
            <p>Trees are an amazing part of God&apos;s Creation and what sparked our interest in gardening and growing plants. There are so many 
                species of trees, especially in the Eastern US, which is naturally forested, that there are trees for just about every type of 
                growing condition and site.<br /><br />Shrubs make up the understory of forests, and due to their small size, they are often ideal 
                for planting in your yard. Shrubs often have beautiful flowers and fall colors. Just like trees, there are a multitude of shrubs, 
                and there is a species for just about every planting site.</p>
