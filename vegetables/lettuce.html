            <h1>Lettuce</h1>
            <p>Lettuce is one of several cool-season vegetables we are growing this year at DKA Nursery. We especially like to use lettuce 
                in salads, and along those lines we are growing two leaf-type varieties this year. Our experience with a heading variety in 
                the 2022 season showed that leaf varieties are considerably easier to grow and use, so we decided to stick with regular, 
                green leaf-lettuce for 2023. We are excited to try out Strela Green Lettuce this year, a new introduction from Seed Savers 
                Exchange that is said to be similar to lettuces grown in the sixteenth century! We can&apos;t wait to see how it performs. 
                Lettuces come in many different flavors and colors, so we are sure there is a variety to meet your culinary needs.</p>

                    <p class="inner ant">This large green leaf-lettuce is a very popular heirloom that has been grown for over 100 years. 
                        Simpson lacks some of the bitter taste found in red lettuces, and, true to its name, the seeds are indeed a dark 
                        charcoal to black color. Simpson performed extremely well for us in 2022. It held up relatively well under moderate 
                        heat, and we were able to “cut and come again” three or four times before heat set in and the plants fizzled out. 
                        Flavor is exquisite, sweet, and great for salads. We almost found it a pity to add anything else to the salad mix! 
                        Simpson definitely has earned is long-time popularity in home gardening, and we plan to grow it as a staple.</p>

                    <p class="inner ant">A “New for 2023” variety from Seed Savers Exchange, we are excited to try out this unique green leaf 
                        lettuce. Supposed to be nearly identical to varieties grown in the 1500&apos;s, this particular variety was bred by 
                        lifetime Seed Savers Exchange member (and expert lettuce breeder) Dr. Alan Kapuler. Strela Green has a rather unusual 
                        rosette form. See the link below for pictures, as this is a difficult phenomenon to explain. The leaves themselves 
                        resemble those of the deer tongue varieties. We can&apos;t wait to try out this highly praised new-yet-old 
                        lettuce!</p>
