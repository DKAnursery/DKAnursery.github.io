            <h1>Beans</h1>
            <p>Beans come in many variations for many varied uses. We are primarily growing green-bean, also known as snap-bean, varieties, 
                but there are also many great dry-beans out there. We found a little-known seed source of Appalachian Heirloom beans and 
                can&apos;t wait to try out several of their highly acclaimed varieties in 2023.</p>

                            that this variety is “Drought and heat tolerant, it is one of the most productive dry beans. … This beautiful, 
                            large, plump bean can be harvested throughout the growing season... providing you with green beans early in the 
                            season, followed by shellies (shelled out while the bean is formed but still soft), and, at the end of the season, 
                            as dry beans for long-term storage! This highly productive bean variety was named to the 
                            <a href="https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/hidatsa-shield-figure-bean/" target="_blank">Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste</a> 
                            for its wonderful flavor and cooking qualities. We use it in soups and stews, as it reheats nicely, without 
                            falling apart. Also makes a wonderful humus in place of chickpeas.” We are looking forward to growing this piece

                            uninitiated. Like many heirlooms, this bean is named for several of its characteristics. First, “Small Speckled”, 
                            because the pods don&apos;t grow extremely long and the mature seeds have a beautiful speckled pattern. Second, 
                            “Greasy”, because this variety doesn&apos;t have the fuzz found on most beans. Finally, “Cut-Short”, which 
                            references the trait of this variety to pack the seeds so closely in the pod that the ends of the seeds square 
                            off or are “cut short”. This is actually a highly desirable trait because there is more protein and less space 
                            in the pod as compared to average beans. We hope you&apos;ll give this great little bean with the long name a try! 
                            One last note, from <a href="https://www.heirlooms.org/" target="_blank">our seed source</a>: “From West Virginia, 
                            this bean is a small brown-speckled greasy cut-short with tightly packed seeds. Given to me by Lothar Baumann, 
                            whose brother obtained it while working in West Virginia, this bean is short but highly productive.”</p>

                            Co. in Bismarck, ND as part of his 1915 Pioneer Indian Collection. Semi-vining, productive bush plant will climb 
                            to three feet if given support. You'll be gifted with plump red beans, very similar to the kidney bean for use
